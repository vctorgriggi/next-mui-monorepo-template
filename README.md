# Next.js MUI Monorepo Template 🚀

An opinionated starter for building MUI-based dashboards on Next.js 15. Ships with a feature-based architecture, typed server actions, React Query helpers, and a client-side RBAC scaffold — without locking you into any backend or auth provider.

> This is **not** a minimal starter. It bundles patterns, conventions, and a deeply customized MUI theme that are worth keeping across projects.

## ✨ What's inside

🎨 **MUI dashboard shell** — Sidebar, navbar, dark/light/system mode, deeply customized theme
🧩 **Feature-based structure** — `actions.ts` / `hooks.ts` / `keys.ts` / `validators.ts` / `types.ts` per feature
⚡ **Server actions** with typed `Result<T>` returns — no thrown errors crossing the wire
🔁 **React Query helpers** — `fromResult` + `useOptionalQuery` + factory-built query keys
📋 **React Hook Form + Zod** — one schema validates the form, types the input, and feeds the server action
🔐 **Client-side RBAC** — `admin`/`editor`/`viewer`/`user` with a `RolesProvider` adapter; plug any auth backend in 10 lines
🎭 **Auth pages** — sign in, sign up, forgot password (Zod + RHF, no backend wired)
🧱 **Compound components** — `FilterCard`, `FormGrid` for filters and form layouts
📦 **Monorepo** — pnpm workspaces + Turborepo; shared `@template/ui`, `@template/shared`, `@template/config`
🚦 **GitHub Actions** — lint + test + type-check + build on every PR

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <your-folder>

# Enable pnpm (one-time, via corepack which ships with Node 20+)
corepack enable

# Install
pnpm install

# Run the app
pnpm --filter @template/web dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. The template ships with **mocked data** so every page works out of the box. Sign-in/sign-up accept any input and drop you on the dashboard.

## 🏗️ Architectural Decisions

This template makes strong, explicit choices. Each is documented in [`docs/`](docs/).

✅ **Feature-based folders** — every domain has the same six files in the same order. No `hooks/` or `services/` lint-bin folders.
✅ **`Result<T>` over throws** — server actions return `{ success, data } | { success, error }`. Errors are typed strings, not opaque exceptions.
✅ **React Query + RHF** — no Redux, no Context for server data. RHF for forms, React Query for the cache.
✅ **One Zod schema per form** — validation + types + error messages, one source of truth.
✅ **Backend-agnostic** — no Supabase, no NextAuth, no DB locked in. Auth/data adapters live in `RolesProvider`, the middleware, and feature `actions.ts` files — replace at will.
✅ **MUI Pro removed** — uses only Community packages; no license key required.

  web/                              # The dashboard app — :3000
    app/
      (public)/                     # Auth pages (sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password)
      (private)/                    # Dashboard, users, account, about
    features/                       # Domain features (users, account) — mocked
    components/                     # ArrowBackLink, ClickableCard, layout/
    lib/auth/                       # RBAC permissions, hasAccess, getDefaultRoute
    lib/env/                        # Zod-validated env vars (client + server)
    layouts/Dshb.tsx                # Sidebar + header + main shell
    providers/                      # RolesProvider, QueryProvider, NotificationsProvider
    constants/app-routes.ts         # Single source of truth for route paths
    middleware.ts                   # No-op middleware (wire your auth here)

packages/
  ui/        # @template/ui      — MUI components + theme
  shared/    # @template/shared  — Result, query helpers, date, validators
  config/    # @template/config  — base tsconfigs

docs/        # Conventions, design system, access control, environments, git workflow
```

Each app imports shared code via `@template/ui`, `@template/shared`. Inside an app, use the `@/` alias (`@/features/users`, `@/lib/auth/permissions`, etc.).

## 🎯 When this template is a good fit

- You're building a **dashboard or backoffice app** with MUI.
- You want **opinions** about feature organization, error handling, and form validation — not a blank slate.
- You're **comfortable with TypeScript** and don't mind learning a few project-specific patterns.

## ⚠️ When it's NOT a good fit

- You want the smallest possible starter — try [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) instead.
- You're not using MUI — the theme and shell are deeply customized to it.
- You need a specific backend pre-wired (Supabase, Firebase) — fork and add it, but you'll fight some abstractions.
